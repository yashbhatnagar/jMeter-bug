<h1>Version 2.5.1</h1>

<h2>Summary of main changes</h2>

<ul>
</ul>


<!--  ========================= End of summary ===================================== -->

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

<p>
The Include Controller has some problems in non-GUI mode. 
In particular, it can cause a NullPointerException if there are two include controllers with the same name.
</p>

<p>Once Only controller behaves correctly under a Thread Group or Loop Controller,
but otherwise its behaviour is not consistent (or clearly specified).</p>

<p>
The menu item Options / Choose Language does not change all the displayed text to the new language.
[The behaviour has improved, but language change is still not fully working]
To override the default local language fully, set the JMeter property "language" before starting JMeter. 
</p>

<h2>Incompatible changes</h2>

<p>
The HttpClient4 sampler as implemented in version 2.5 used a retry count of 3.
As this can hide server errors, JMeter now sets the retry count to 0 to prevent any automatic retries.
This can be overridden by setting the JMeter property <b>httpclient4.retrycount</b>.
</p>
